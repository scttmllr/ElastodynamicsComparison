This is a collection of work to compare multiple
finite element formulations for linearized
elastodynamics.  Methods include one and two-field
continuous Galerkin, and multiple discontinuous
Galerkin formulations.  All of these are discretized
via the method of lines in space.  The time derivatives
are then discretized by a variety of methods.
